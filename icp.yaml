# NOTE: Backend Motoko build currently fails with the default Motoko source
# while using the icp-cli recipe. Removing the backend canister from the project
# allows working on frontend development and deploying the asset canister only.
# To restore full multi-canister deploy, re-add the backend build steps and
# ensure `moc` compilation succeeds.
